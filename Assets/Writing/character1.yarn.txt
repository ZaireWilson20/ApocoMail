We-ll, its very nice to meet you. If you need me, I'll just be here... or over there... or over there... or over there....
b-But if you... see any fireflies, could you bring some to me-e? 
I just need them... for a special project. It gets very dark in my bubble overnight, but I-
I can't go out today to get more, and I feel so bad keeping them multiple nights, but-
[[Why can't you go get them?|Bub8]]

aAND LEAVE THE BUBBLE?? No one leaves their bubble! Imagine what might happen!
I could die! I could stub my toe on a rock! Spiders could fall from the trees into my hair! Gnomes might eat my shoes!
It's safe in my bubble. I'M safe in my bubble. If e-everyone were smart, they'd get a great bubble like me. All I need are some fireflies...

You survived! I mean, you didnt have a bubble or anything. I-I was worried. 
Wait, what do you have?
Oh! those look nice and bright, those will work great!Here, p-put them down, I'll use my bubble powers to get them.
There we go, these look perfect. Now to just - this will-ttake me a while, but you can come back later if-if you want to chat.
W-wait! Here, you can take this as thanks. It's a spare copy of my favorite album. I don't need it since I don't have to leave anymore.

I lost my twine! My string! I-it should be right here! did I run out?
Everything is ruined! How am I supposed to make bubble lights without string? 
Thanks for all the help-- b-but I should stop wasting your time.
Its-could you find some for me maybe? If not -its fine, I, maybe It'll be easier if I use my hair? Oo, but.. Please don't worry. Just enjoy your afternoon.
